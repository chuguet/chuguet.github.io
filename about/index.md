Senior Software Developer, restless mind always trying to learn more and more.

#My way

Born in Puente Genil, a small town from Córdoba, when I finished my IT studies I started to work developing applications in the area of information technologies.

I have done everything since development to requirements analysis and new architectures, increasingly interested in developing applications with J2EE and Front-end frameworks.

Strong supporter of TDD, using several technologies such as JUnit, mockito, spring testing framework, jasmineJS…
